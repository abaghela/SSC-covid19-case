# SSC-covid19-case
Statistical Society of Canada (SSC) Covid-19 Case Competition

This respository contains the work performed for the [SSC 2021 Case Studies in
Data Analysis
Competition](https://ssc.ca/en/meetings/annual/2021-annual-meeting/case-studies-competition).
Our team is working on Case Study #2: Modeling COVID-19 disease dynamics in
Canada.

## Research questions (WIP)

We need 1-3 research questions to focus our poster on. Some ideas include:

- What is the impact of lockdowns of varying length on the spread of COVID-19 in
British Columbia?
- How does the mass administration of COVID-19 vaccines affect case numbers?
- How does the emergence of variants of COVID-19, with higher rates of
transmission and infection, impact mortality in British Columbia?

## Poster details

- Submitted poster must be a PDF
- Max size is 3.5 feet wide, 4 feet tall
